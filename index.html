        <h1>Information Technology</h1>
        <h2>What does it means to me?</h2>
          <p>Information Technology is the backbone of all technology we have today and this is something I always like to talk about.
            I would like to use my passion in science to this industry as the meaning of my existence to create something really relivant
            and useful to everyone. Creating something that helps human to enhance their productivity for future innovation is very
            meaningful and being part of this advancement as one of those people who shaping the world into a better place is very rewarding.
            As today's advancement often technologies are utilised in a wrong place and having wrong impact, however, right mindset
            and right motives on the project these technologies can be very useful to benifits us and the future generations that are coming.</p>
